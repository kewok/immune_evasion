    "Here we describe in further detail the modeling approach we use to assess the evolutionary invasibility of an immunity-evading strain $\\mu$ of SARS-CoV-2 in a host population in which an ancestral, immune-susceptible strain $A$ circulates. \n",
    "\n",
    "In the absence of vaccination or epidemiologically-relevant variability in the human or viral populations, the ancestral viral strain is assumed to circulate in the host population following an S$\\rightarrow$E$\\rightarrow$I$\\rightarrow$R (Susceptible-Exposed-Infectious-Recovered) compartmental model over the time horizon (170 days following the roll out of vaccinations) that we investigate.  The ancestral strain spreads through frequency-dependent transmission with a per-capita force of infection equal to $\\beta_A I/N$, where $N$ is the host population ($N=S+I+E+R$) and $\\beta_A$ the ancestral strain's infection coefficient. Based on Bi et al. (2020) and Qin et al. (2020), we use an incubation period $\\sigma$ of 8.29 days and an infectious period $\\gamma$ of 5 days. For purposes of the present analyses, we consider disease-induced mortality to not substantively alter the pathogen's dynamics, and that the total host population is approximately constant over the timescale of concern.\n",

    "We then relax the assumption of immunity being acquired solely via infection by allowing susceptible hosts to become vaccinated. Thus, our S$\\rightarrow$E$\\rightarrow$I$\\rightarrow$R model is modified so that vaccinated hosts are diverted into a compartment $V$, representing fully-vaccinated hosts. We assume fully-vaccinated hosts are unable to transmit the ancestral strain, but still circulate in the host population. Thus, after vaccinations begin, $N=S+I+E+R+V$."

    "Broadly, our basic strategy is as follows. First, we estimate the daily infection coefficient $\\beta(t)$ for the ancestral strain $A$ in each polity from daily ($t$) data on incidence, prevalence and vaccination using an Ensemble Kalman Filtering regime. Next, we derive the average number $R_\\mu$ of secondary infections by single, immune-evading mutant strain $\\mu$ arising from a single host in which strain $A$ has mutated to strain $\\mu$. $R_\\mu$, in turn, is a time-dependent quantity whose magnitude depends, in part, on the ancestral strain's infection coefficient $\\beta(t)$ at time $t$. Thus, we characterize how the invasibility of the mutant strain $\\mu$ into the host population changes depending on (i) the phenotypic consequences of the mutation events giving rise to $\\mu$, and (ii) the epidemiological profile (number of susceptible hosts, vaccinated hosts, etc...) of the host population when the mutant emerges.
